Defensive Pass Interference (DPI)

Definition: Contact by a defender that significantly hinders an eligible receiver's opportunity to catch a forward pass. This includes grabbing, restricting, or making early contact before the ball arrives in a way that prevents a natural catch.
Enforcement: When DPI occurs beyond the end zone, the offense receives the ball at the spot of the foul (spot foul) and an automatic first down. If the foul occurs in the end zone, the ball is placed at the 1-yard line (or the nearest enforceable spot) and the offense gets an automatic first down.
Examples: Early arm extension that prevents the receiver from turning to the ball; pulling the receiver’s arm before the ball arrives; playing through the receiver instead of the ball.

Offensive Pass Interference (OPI)

Definition: An act by an offensive player that restricts a defender's ability to play the ball. Examples include pushing off, blocking downfield before the ball arrives, or otherwise creating separation by illegal contact.
Enforcement: OPI is a 10-yard penalty from the previous spot and a loss of down. OPI is not a spot foul.

Roughing the Passer

Definition: Unnecessary or forcible contact against a passer after the ball has left his hand, or forcible contact to the passer's head or neck area during or immediately after the pass. This also covers driving the quarterback into the ground or delivering a particularly violent or late blow.
Enforcement: Roughing the passer is a 15-yard penalty and results in an automatic first down. Incidental contact while attempting to tackle (that is not forcible or to the head/neck) may be permitted, but officials use discretion.
Examples: Hitting the quarterback high (helmet/face/neck), driving the QB into the turf, or hitting the QB well after release.

Personal Fouls

Definition: Major fouls involving unnecessary roughness, violent, or malicious acts that present a safety risk to players. Personal fouls include late hits, hits to the head/neck, striking, and other actions that exceed normal physical play.
Enforcement: Personal fouls are penalized 15 yards. Depending on severity, personal fouls can lead to ejection, automatic first downs for the opponent, and fines or suspensions after league review.

Unsportsmanlike Conduct

Definition: Non-contact or limited-contact offenses that show a lack of sportsmanship — examples include taunting, excessive celebration, removing a helmet on the field in celebration, or using abusive language or gestures.
Enforcement: Typically a 15-yard penalty assessed on the kickoff or the succeeding spot; repeated or severe incidents may result in ejection.

Helmet-to-Helmet / Forcible Contact to Head and Neck Area

Definition: Any forcible contact where a player's helmet makes direct contact with an opponent's helmet, face, or neck area, or where a player targets the head/neck with forcible contact. The NFL prioritizes player safety and treats these plays seriously.
Enforcement: Penalties range from 15 yards and automatic first down to ejection, depending on intent and severity. Plays are frequently subject to automatic review and may incur supplemental discipline.

Other Common Fouls (brief)

Holding: Illegally restricting an opponent's movement (offensive or defensive); typically a 10-yard penalty on the offense or 5 yards on the defense, depending on the type.
Face Mask: Grasping the face mask is a 15-yard penalty; twisting or turning the player's head can escalate enforcement and lead to further discipline.
Illegal Contact / Defensive Holding: Contact by a defender beyond five yards from the line of scrimmage that restricts a receiver; usually a 5–10 yard penalty plus an automatic first down when it is illegal contact on a receiver in certain contexts.
